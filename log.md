### Day 11: 12/29/20 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Still going through basic CSS in freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification. Great refresher!

I've also been studying for the Security+, I'm taking the exam on Jan 10th before the spring semester starts Dragon

**Thoughts**: I forgot a lot of CSS syntax, but freeCodeCamp's setup makes it easy to relearn concepts quickly. 

I need to learn all Sec+ terms in Quizlet set this week.

I've also been brainstorming on potential projects to work on. I think a portfolio website is a good place to start. I also want to try coding web app games.

### Day 12: 12/30/20 Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: Started to use the official 100 Days of Code repo on GitHub, learned how to fork the repo and commit changes. A fork copies the repo so you can work on your own version. 

Also continued with freeCodeCamp's CSS Basics  

**Thoughts**: Had some account issues with freeCodeCamp, resolved. I also brainstormed personal project ideas, saved in Google Drive for now.

### Day 13: 1/4/21 Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Back to studying for the CompTIA Sec+ cert today 
freeCodeCamp is down for maintenance, will resume the Responsive Web Design course tomorrow. 

**Thoughts**: Took a few days off for New Year's

### Day 14: 1/5/21 Tues 

**Today's Progress**: Used a Pomodoro timer Tomato to study for the Security+. First time trying this technique, 
pomofocus has a great timer

Finished freeCodeCamp's CSS Basics. Progress slowed down due to Sec+, but still making time for coding 

**Thoughts**: Pomodoro technique is actually really useful. I was able to compartmentalize time working vs breaks. Established early stages of memorization by going through Quizlet's write-in exercise & writing out all the terms I missed on paper. 

I'd like to apply the Pomodoro technique to the freeCodeCamp cert and future coding projects. I'm thinking my first coding project will be my portfolio site that includes both "neenz_codes" & "neenz_art" content. Might use my portfolio as a landing page that offers users the option to be redirected to either section.

### Day 15: 1/8/21 Fri

**Today's Progress**: Hoping everyone here in the US is doing their best to stay safe & sane. Clearly, the ppl who stormed Capitol Hill had no regard for safety or sanity.  

Studied for the Sec+ today & started freeCodeCamp's Applied Visual Design

### Day 16: 1/11/21 Mon

**Today's Progress**: Started the last semester of my Associate's in Info Sys Tech - Web Development! Woo 

Continued with Sec+ studying & freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design 

**Thoughts**: I was supposed to take the Sec+ yesterday, but I ended up moving it. I need to commit to *CONSISTENT* study habits. I've been averaging 50% on SkillProCert's practice tests :( Need to get average up to passing (85%) before I take the exam. Target date is Sunday 1/24/21.

Web Design II class is going to provide real-world web design experience. Inspired to start my personal portfolio website! (Looking into using Gatsby)
